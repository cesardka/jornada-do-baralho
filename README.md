"Jornada do Baralho" (or "Deck's Journey") is a playful nod to the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey), mentioned by [Eduardo Spohr](https://www.instagram.com/duduspohr/)'s multiple times over the years during his storytelling lessons.

This project is my personal quest to complete the legendary Deck Challenge, a challenge born in 2012 that remains unconquered.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This is a personal initiative by [César Hoffmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c%C3%A9sar-hoffmann/) to build a virtual board chronicling my journey to complete the Deck Challenge. For over a decade, no one has claimed the prize.

With the possibility of the [Nerdcast](https://jovemnerd.com.br/podcasts/) podcast ending at episode 1000, I saw the perfect opportunity to pursue this ambitious goal: securing signatures on all the face cards before the iconic podcast hosts move on to new ventures for good.

I hadn’t purchased the deck until I decided to take on this challenge. My first attempt, on [Enjoei](https://www.enjoei.com.br/p/baralho-nerdcast-rpg-algumas-cartas-autografadas-93103206?vid=332492ff-e6b9-4f26-8667-90f70376512d) (October 11th, 2024), ended in disappointment when the shipment was stolen. It was devastating to think I might have lost my only chance—especially since that deck already included several signed cards!

Thankfully, on November 13th, I discovered another listing on [Mercado Livre](https://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-4649269134-baralho-nerdcast-jovem-nerd-_JM?quantity=1&variation_id=182642369255). Since this deck didn’t have any signed cards, I purchased it immediately. This allowed me to scan the cards in a mint state, start coding the website, and begin planning how to get all the signatures before Nerdcast #1000. Now, the real journey begins!

## 🃏 The Deck Challenge

A new Deck Card, in partnership with Copag, including multiple members of the Nerdcast family, was released by episode [Nerdcast 312 - Nerdcast do Baralho!](https://jovemnerd.com.br/podcasts/nerdcast/nerdcast-312-nercast-do-baralho) to the [Nerdstore](https://web.archive.org/web/20120614130518/http://www.nerdstore.com.br/produto/baralho-jn.html)

Following up that, the Deck Challenge was announced on the next episode [Nerdcast 313 - HQ: Os Novos 52](https://jovemnerd.com.br/podcasts/nerdcast/nerdcast-313-hq-os-velhos-novos-52) by [Azaghal](https://www.instagram.com/azaghal) and [Jovem Nerd](https://www.instagram.com/jovemnerd/)

## 🔥 Challenge Rules:

1. Collect signatures on all 16 face cards, 2 jokers, and 1 bonus card.
2. Each signature must be accompanied by a photo of the card being signed.
3. Once all cards are signed, they must be shipped to Azaghal and Jovem Nerd.

## 🏆 The Prize:

The reward for completing the challenge is an iPad of the latest generation at the time of completion. (Fun fact: when this challenge was announced, the "current generation" was the 3rd-gen iPad!)

This project is not just about completing a challenge -- it's about storytelling, community, and paying homage to the creators who inspired me since 2007, when I started listening to them as a 14yo.

Thank you for stopping by, reading this README in English despite (possibly) both me and you being Brazilian, and feel free to join me on this epic journey! ✨

I will update the website as the cards get signed. 🖖😉
